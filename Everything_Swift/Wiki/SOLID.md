# SOLID Principle

- S - Single Responsibility - each  
- O - Open/Close - open for extensions but close from changes in implementations
- L - Liskov principle - Make new ones instead of inherit
- I - Interface Segregation - separate the methods/properties in to smaller protocols rather than a fat protocol
- D - Dependency Inversion - base classes should not depend on the subclass
